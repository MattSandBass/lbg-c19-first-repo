This is an example git repository. Here is some **bold text** just for fun.
## Contents

* [Installation](#installation)
* [Usage](#usage)

## Installation
This would normally describe what to do to install this application, and ti would probably be quite a long explanation, whereas this is rather short.

## Usage
This will detail how to use the application, and because it is incredibly complex this section is also likely to be rather lengthy. The contents links at the top of this readme should help with navigation.

To show some unformated code examples you can do this:

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
this is some other funky stuff you can do
